## What Causes Rufus Error: Access to the Device is Denied?
 
There are several possible reasons why Rufus may fail to access the USB device and display this error. Some of the common causes are:
 
- **Controlled Folder Access:** This is a feature of Windows 10 that protects your files and folders from unauthorized changes by apps. If this feature is enabled, it may block Rufus from accessing the USB drive. You can disable this feature or add Rufus as an allowed app in Windows Security settings.
- **Antivirus or Firewall Software:** Some antivirus or firewall programs may interfere with Rufus and prevent it from accessing the USB drive. You can try disabling your antivirus or firewall temporarily or adding Rufus as an exception in their settings.
- **ISO File Location:** If you have stored your ISO file on the same USB drive that you are trying to format with Rufus, you will get this error. This is because Rufus will erase everything on the USB drive before copying the ISO file contents. You need to move your ISO file to a different location before using Rufus.
- **Bad Blocks or Corrupted USB Drive:** If your USB drive has bad sectors or is corrupted, Rufus may not be able to write to it properly. You can check your USB drive for bad blocks using Rufus or another tool and try formatting it again.
- **USB Port or Computer Issue:** Sometimes, the problem may be with the USB port or the computer that you are using. You can try plugging your USB drive into a different port or using a different computer to see if that works.

## How to Fix Rufus Error: Access to the Device is Denied?
 
To fix this error, you need to identify and resolve the cause that is preventing Rufus from accessing your USB device. Here are some steps that you can follow:

1. **Disable Controlled Folder Access:** To disable this feature in Windows 10, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Manage ransomware protection. Then turn off Controlled folder access. Alternatively, you can add Rufus as an allowed app by clicking on Allow an app through Controlled folder access and browsing for Rufus.exe.
2. **Disable Antivirus or Firewall Software:** To disable your antivirus or firewall software temporarily, you can right-click on its icon in the system tray and select Disable or Turn off. Alternatively, you can add Rufus as an exception in their settings by following their instructions. For example, if you are using ESET Antivirus, you need to disable its Device Control feature or add Rufus as an allowed device.
3. **Move ISO File Location:** To move your ISO file to a different location, you can simply drag and drop it to another folder or drive on your computer. Make sure that the new location has enough space to store the ISO file and that it is not on the same USB drive that you are trying to format with Rufus.
4. **Check USB Drive for Bad Blocks:** To check your USB drive for bad blocks using Rufus, you need to enable the advanced format options by clicking on the small triangle next to Format Options. Then check the box next to Check device for bad blocks and select how many passes you want to run. Then click on Start and wait for Rufus to scan your USB drive. If any bad blocks are found, Rufus will try to fix them or mark them as unusable.
5. **Format USB Drive Again:** After checking your USB drive for bad blocks, you can try formatting it again with Ruf 8cf37b1e13
