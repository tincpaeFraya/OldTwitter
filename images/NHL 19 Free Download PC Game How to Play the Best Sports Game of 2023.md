One option is to use a PS4 or Xbox One emulator, which is a software that mimics the console's hardware and software on your PC. This way, you can run NHL 19 as if you were playing it on a console. However, emulators are not officially supported by EA Sports or the console manufacturers, and they may have legal, ethical, and technical issues. Emulators may also require a lot of processing power and storage space on your PC, and they may not run smoothly or at all. Therefore, use emulators at your own risk and discretion.
 
Another option is to sign up for a cloud gaming service, such as PlayStation Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming. These services allow you to stream NHL 19 from a remote server to your PC via an internet connection. This way, you don't need to download or install anything on your PC, and you can play NHL 19 with minimal lag and high quality. However, cloud gaming services may require a subscription fee, a compatible controller, and a fast and stable internet connection. They may also have limited availability depending on your region and device.
 
A third option is to wait for EA Sports to release NHL 19 for PC in the future. Although there is no official confirmation or announcement from EA Sports yet, there are some signs that indicate that NHL 19 may come to PC someday. For example, in an interview with PC Gamer in 2018[^2^], NHL 19 creative director William Ho said that he would love to bring NHL 19 to PC if there was enough demand from the fans. He also said that EA Sports was exploring new platforms and technologies for their games. Moreover, there is an online petition on Change.org[^1^] that has over 20,000 signatures from fans who want NHL 19 on PC. Therefore, there is still hope that EA Sports will listen to the fans and make NHL 19 available for PC in the near future.
 
In conclusion, NHL 19 is an amazing hockey game that PC gamers should not miss out on. There are several ways to play NHL 19 on PC, such as using emulators, cloud gaming services, or waiting for an official release. Each option has its own pros and cons, so you should choose the one that suits your needs and preferences best. Whichever option you choose, you will surely have a blast playing NHL 19 on PC.
